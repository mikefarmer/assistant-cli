## Risk Mitigation

- **Google Cloud API Changes**: Use vendored dependencies and version pinning
- **Authentication Complexity**: Start with API key, add other methods incrementally ✅ MITIGATED
- **Platform Differences**: Test early and often on all platforms
- **Scope Creep**: Defer Phase 2 features, maintain focus on core TTS functionality

## Implementation Notes
